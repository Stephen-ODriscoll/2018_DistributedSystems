# 2018_Distributed_Systems

Project simulates a distributed system.

ProjectRMI and ProjectSockets adds the distributed elements.

I have built a GUI-based file-sharing application (which is also a media player).

There is a shared folder in which all available media files are stored centrally.

The shared folder is available to all client applications.

Client applications allow users to list and download remote media files.

Downloaded files will be stored in local folders.

Only locally-downloaded files can be “played” by the media player.

Criteria for grading that my project meets:

The GUI client should within a short amount of time (e.g. within 5 seconds) add any new remote files that have been uploaded to the local list of available files.

Available files in this list (ones that have not yet been downloaded) will be available to download (e.g. add a download button next to the file).

Added facilities to change the location of remote and local folders, e.g. change them via a GUI popup window(s).
